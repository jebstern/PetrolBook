# PetrolBook

This is a demo app that I'm developing to learn more about popular technologies in Android development.
Firebase is good candidate for storing data and syncing it between users, but I wanted to use my own REST API.


Implemented stuff (still more to come):
- RxJava
- RetroFit (using GSON)
- Realm


Not yet implemented:
- Butter knife
- MVP pattern
- Custom animations (if needed)
- Testing
